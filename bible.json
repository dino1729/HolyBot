    "2.20": "The Jews therefore said, \u201cIt took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it up in three days?\u201d",
    "2.21": "But he spoke of the temple of his body.",
    "2.22": "When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.",
    "2.23": "Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did.",
    "2.24": "But Jesus didn\u2019t entrust himself to them, because he knew everyone,",
    "2.25": "and because he didn\u2019t need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.",
    "3.1": "Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.",
    "3.2": "The same came to him by night, and said to him, \u201cRabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.\u201d",
    "3.3": "Jesus answered him,\u201cMost certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew,he can\u2019t see God\u2019s Kingdom.\u201d",
    "3.4": "Nicodemus said to him, \u201cHow can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother\u2019s womb, and be born?\u201d",
    "3.5": "Jesus answered,\u201cMost certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can\u2019t enter into God\u2019s Kingdom.",
    "3.6": "That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.",
    "3.7": "Don\u2019t marvel that I said to you, \u2018You must be born anew.\u2019",
    "3.8": "The windblows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don\u2019t know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.\u201d",
    "3.9": "Nicodemus answered him, \u201cHow can these things be?\u201d",
    "3.10": "Jesus answered him,\u201cAre you the teacher of Israel, and don\u2019t understand these things?",
    "3.11": "Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you don\u2019t receive our witness.",
    "3.12": "If I told you earthly things and you don\u2019t believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?",
    "3.13": "No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.",
    "3.14": "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,",
    "3.15": "that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.",
    "3.16": "For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.",
    "3.17": "For God didn\u2019t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.",
    "3.18": "He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn\u2019t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.",
    "3.19": "This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.",
    "3.20": "For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn\u2019t come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.",
    "3.21": "But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.\u201d",
    "3.22": "After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them, and baptized.",
    "3.23": "John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized.",
    "3.24": "For John was not yet thrown into prison.",
    "3.25": "There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John\u2019s disciples with some Jews about purification.",
    "3.26": "They came to John, and said to him, \u201cRabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.\u201d",
    "3.27": "John answered, \u201cA man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven.",
    "3.28": "You yourselves testify that I said, \u2018I am not the Christ,\u2019 but, \u2018I have been sent before him.\u2019",
    "3.29": "He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom\u2019s voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.",
    "3.30": "He must increase, but I must decrease.",
    "3.31": "He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.",
    "3.32": "What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.",
    "3.33": "He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.",
    "3.34": "For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.",
    "3.35": "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.",
    "3.36": "One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won\u2019t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.\u201d",
    "4.1": "Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John",
    "4.2": "(although Jesus himself didn\u2019t baptize, but his disciples),",
    "4.3": "he left Judea, and departed into Galilee.",
    "4.4": "He needed to pass through Samaria.",
    "4.5": "So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.",
    "4.6": "Jacob\u2019s well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.",
    "4.7": "A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her,\u201cGive me a drink.\u201d",
    "4.8": "For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.",
    "4.9": "The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, \u201cHow is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?\u201d (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)",
    "4.10": "Jesus answered her,\u201cIf you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, \u2018Give me a drink,\u2019 you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.\u201d",
    "4.11": "The woman said to him, \u201cSir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. So where do you get that living water?",
    "4.12": "Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?\u201d",
    "4.13": "Jesus answered her,\u201cEveryone who drinks of this water will thirst again,",
    "4.14": "but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.\u201d",
    "4.15": "The woman said to him, \u201cSir, give me this water, so that I don\u2019t get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw.\u201d",
    "4.16": "Jesus said to her,\u201cGo, call your husband, and come here.\u201d",
    "4.17": "The woman answered, \u201cI have no husband.\u201dJesus said to her,\u201cYou said well, \u2018I have no husband,\u2019",
    "4.18": "for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly.\u201d",
    "4.19": "The woman said to him, \u201cSir, I perceive that you are a prophet.",
    "4.20": "Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.\u201d",
    "4.21": "Jesus said to her,\u201cWoman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.",
    "4.22": "You worship that which you don\u2019t know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.",
    "4.23": "But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshipers.",
    "4.24": "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u201d",
    "4.25": "The woman said to him, \u201cI know that Messiah comes, he who is called Christ. When he has come, he will declare to us all things.\u201d",
    "4.26": "Jesus said to her,\u201cI am he, the one who speaks to you.\u201d",
    "4.27": "At this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d or, \u201cWhy do you speak with her?\u201d",
    "4.28": "So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,",
    "4.29": "\u201cCome, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?\u201d",
    "4.30": "They went out of the city, and were coming to him.",
    "4.31": "In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, \u201cRabbi, eat.\u201d",
    "4.32": "But he said to them,\u201cI have food to eat that you don\u2019t know about.\u201d",
    "4.33": "The disciples therefore said to one another, \u201cHas anyone brought him something to eat?\u201d",
    "4.34": "Jesus said to them,\u201cMy food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.",
    "4.35": "Don\u2019t you say, \u2018There are yet four months until the harvest?\u2019 Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.",
    "4.36": "He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.",
    "4.37": "For in this the saying is true, \u2018One sows, and another reaps.\u2019",
    "4.38": "I sent you to reap that for which you haven\u2019t labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.\u201d",
    "4.39": "From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, \u201cHe told me everything that I did.\u201d",
    "4.40": "So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.",
    "4.41": "Many more believed because of his word.",
    "4.42": "They said to the woman, \u201cNow we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.\u201d",
    "4.43": "After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.",
    "4.44": "For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.",
    "4.45": "So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.",
    "4.46": "Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.",
    "4.47": "When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.",
    "4.48": "Jesus therefore said to him,\u201cUnless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe.\u201d",
    "4.49": "The nobleman said to him, \u201cSir, come down before my child dies.\u201d",
    "4.50": "Jesus said to him,\u201cGo your way. Your son lives.\u201d The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.",
    "4.51": "As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying \u201cYour child lives!\u201d",
    "4.52": "So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, \u201cYesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him.\u201d",
    "4.53": "So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him,\u201cYour son lives.\u201d He believed, as did his whole house.",
    "4.54": "This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.",
    "5.1": "After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
    "5.2": "Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, \u201cBethesda\u201d, having five porches.",
    "5.3": "In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;",
    "5.4": "for an angel went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had.",
    "5.5": "A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.",
    "5.6": "When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him,\u201cDo you want to be made well?\u201d",
    "5.7": "The sick man answered him, \u201cSir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I\u2019m coming, another steps down before me.\u201d",
    "5.8": "Jesus said to him,\u201cArise, take up your mat, and walk.\u201d",
    "5.9": "Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked.Now it was the Sabbath on that day.",
    "5.10": "So the Jews said to him who was cured, \u201cIt is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.\u201d",
    "5.11": "He answered them, \u201cHe who made me well, the same said to me,\u2018Take up your mat, and walk.\u2019\u201d",
    "5.12": "Then they asked him, \u201cWho is the man who said to you,\u2018Take up your mat, and walk\u2019?\u201d",
    "5.13": "But he who was healed didn\u2019t know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.",
    "5.14": "Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him,\u201cBehold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.\u201d",
    "5.15": "The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.",
    "5.16": "For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.",
    "5.17": "But Jesus answered them,\u201cMy Father is still working, so I am working, too.\u201d",
    "5.18": "For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.",
    "5.19": "Jesus therefore answered them,\u201cMost certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.",
    "5.20": "For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.",
    "5.21": "For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.",
    "5.22": "For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,",

    "5.24": "\u201cMost certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn\u2019t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.",
    "5.25": "Most certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God\u2019s voice; and those who hear will live.",
    "5.26": "For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.",
    "5.27": "He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.",
    "5.28": "Don\u2019t marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,",

    "5.34": "But the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.",
    "5.35": "He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.",
    "5.36": "But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me.",
    "5.37": "The Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.",

    "6.3": "Jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.",
    "6.4": "Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.",
    "6.5": "Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip,\u201cWhere are we to buy bread, that these may eat?\u201d",
    "6.6": "This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.",
    "6.7": "Philip answered him, \u201cTwo hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little.\u201d",
    "6.8": "One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter\u2019s brother, said to him,",

    "6.12": "When they were filled, he said to his disciples,\u201cGather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost.\u201d",
    "6.13": "So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.",
    "6.14": "When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, \u201cThis is truly the prophet who comes into the world.\u201d",
    "6.15": "Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.",
    "6.16": "When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,",
    "6.17": "and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.",
    "6.18": "The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.",
    "6.19": "When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.",
    "6.20": "But he said to them,\u201cIt is I.Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d",
    "6.21": "They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.",
    "6.22": "On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn\u2019t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.",
    "6.23": "However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.",
    "6.24": "When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn\u2019t there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.",
    "6.25": "When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, \u201cRabbi, when did you come here?\u201d",
    "6.26": "Jesus answered them,\u201cMost certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.",
    "6.27": "Don\u2019t work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.\u201d",

    "6.31": "Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, \u2018He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.\u2019\u201d",
    "6.32": "Jesus therefore said to them,\u201cMost certainly, I tell you, it wasn\u2019t Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.",
    "6.33": "For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.\u201d",
    "6.34": "They said therefore to him, \u201cLord, always give us this bread.\u201d",

    "6.37": "All those whom the Father gives me will come to me. He who comes to me I will in no way throw out.",
    "6.38": "For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.",
    "6.39": "This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.",
    "6.40": "This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\u201d",
    "6.41": "The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said,\u201cI am the bread which came down out of heaven.\u201d",
    "6.42": "They said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say,\u2018I have come down out of heaven?\u2019\u201d",
    "6.43": "Therefore Jesus answered them,\u201cDon\u2019t murmur among yourselves.",
    "6.44": "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.",
    "6.45": "It is written in the prophets, \u2018They will all be taught by God.\u2019Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.",

    "6.52": "The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, \u201cHow can this man give us his flesh to eat?\u201d",
    "6.53": "Jesus therefore said to them,\u201cMost certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don\u2019t have life in yourselves.",
    "6.54": "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "6.55": "For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.",
    "6.56": "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.",
    "6.57": "As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.",
    "6.58": "This is the bread which came down out of heaven\u2014not as our fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.\u201d",
    "6.59": "He said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.",
    "6.60": "Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, \u201cThis is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?\u201d",
    "6.61": "But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them,\u201cDoes this cause you to stumble?",
    "6.62": "Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?",
    "6.63": "It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.",
    "6.64": "But there are some of you who don\u2019t believe.\u201d For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn\u2019t believe, and who it was who would betray him.",
    "6.65": "He said,\u201cFor this cause I have said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.\u201d",
    "6.66": "At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.",
    "6.67": "Jesus said therefore to the twelve,\u201cYou don\u2019t also want to go away, do you?\u201d",
    "6.68": "Simon Peter answered him, \u201cLord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.",
    "6.69": "We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\u201d",
    "6.70": "Jesus answered them,\u201cDidn\u2019t I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?\u201d",
    "6.71": "Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.",
    "7.1": "After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn\u2019t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.",
    "7.2": "Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.",
    "7.3": "His brothers therefore said to him, \u201cDepart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.",
    "7.4": "For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.\u201d",
    "7.5": "For even his brothers didn\u2019t believe in him.",
    "7.6": "Jesus therefore said to them,\u201cMy time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.",
    "7.7": "The world can\u2019t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.",
    "7.8": "You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.\u201d",
    "7.9": "Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.",
    "7.10": "But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.",
    "7.11": "The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d",
    "7.12": "There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, \u201cHe is a good man.\u201d Others said, \u201cNot so, but he leads the multitude astray.\u201d",
    "7.13": "Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.",
    "7.14": "But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.",
    "7.15": "The Jews therefore marveled, saying, \u201cHow does this man know letters, having never been educated?\u201d",
    "7.16": "Jesus therefore answered them,\u201cMy teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.",
    "7.17": "If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself.",
    "7.18": "He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.",
    "7.19": "Didn\u2019t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?\u201d",
    "7.20": "The multitude answered, \u201cYou have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?\u201d",
    "7.21": "Jesus answered them,\u201cI did one work, and you all marvel because of it.",
    "7.22": "Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.",
    "7.23": "If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?",
    "7.24": "Don\u2019t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.\u201d",
    "7.25": "Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this he whom they seek to kill?",
    "7.26": "Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?",
    "7.27": "However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.\u201d",
    "7.28": "Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying,\u201cYou both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don\u2019t know.",
    "7.29": "I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.\u201d",
    "7.30": "They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.",
    "7.31": "But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, \u201cWhen the Christ comes, he won\u2019t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?\u201d",
    "7.32": "The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.",
    "7.33": "Then Jesus said,\u201cI will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me.",
    "7.34": "You will seek me, and won\u2019t find me; and where I am, you can\u2019t come.\u201d",

    "7.36": "What is this word that he said,\u2018You will seek me, and won\u2019t find me; and where I am, you can\u2019t come\u2019?\u201d",
    "7.37": "Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out,\u201cIf anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!",
    "7.38": "He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.\u201d",
    "7.39": "But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn\u2019t yet glorified.",

    "8.43": "Why don\u2019t you understand my speech? Because you can\u2019t hear my word.",
    "8.44": "You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn\u2019t stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and the father of lies.",
    "8.45": "But because I tell the truth, you don\u2019t believe me.",
    "8.46": "Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?",

    "8.52": "Then the Jews said to him, \u201cNow we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say,\u2018If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.\u2019",
    "8.53": "Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?\u201d",
    "8.54": "Jesus answered,\u201cIf I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.",
    "8.55": "You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know him,\u2019 I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.",

    "9.6": "When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man\u2019s eyes with the mud,",
    "9.7": "and said to him,\u201cGo, wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (which means \u201cSent\u201d). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.",
    "9.8": "The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this he who sat and begged?\u201d",

    "9.14": "It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.",
    "9.15": "Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, \u201cHe put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.\u201d",
    "9.16": "Some therefore of the Pharisees said, \u201cThis man is not from God, because he doesn\u2019t keep the Sabbath.\u201d Others said, \u201cHow can a man who is a sinner do such signs?\u201d There was division among them.",
    "9.17": "Therefore they asked the blind man again, \u201cWhat do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?\u201dHe said, \u201cHe is a prophet.\u201d",

    "18.28": "They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn\u2019t enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.",
    "18.29": "Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, \u201cWhat accusation do you bring against this man?\u201d",
    "18.30": "They answered him, \u201cIf this man weren\u2019t an evildoer, we wouldn\u2019t have delivered him up to you.\u201d",
    "18.31": "Pilate therefore said to them, \u201cTake him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.\u201dTherefore the Jews said to him, \u201cIt is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,\u201d",
    "18.32": "that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.",
    "18.33": "Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d",
    "18.34": "Jesus answered him,\u201cDo you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?\u201d",
    "18.35": "Pilate answered, \u201cI\u2019m not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?\u201d",
    "18.36": "Jesus answered,\u201cMy Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn\u2019t be delivered to the Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here.\u201d",
    "18.37": "Pilate therefore said to him, \u201cAre you a king then?\u201dJesus answered,\u201cYou say that I am a king. For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.\u201d",
    "18.38": "Pilate said to him, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201dWhen he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, \u201cI find no basis for a charge against him.",
    "18.39": "But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?\u201d",
    "18.40": "Then they all shouted again, saying, \u201cNot this man, but Barabbas!\u201d Now Barabbas was a robber.",

    "19.3": "They kept saying, \u201cHail, King of the Jews!\u201d and they kept slapping him.",
    "19.4": "Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, \u201cBehold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him.\u201d",
    "19.5": "Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, \u201cBehold, the man!\u201d",
    "19.6": "When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, \u201cCrucify! Crucify!\u201dPilate said to them, \u201cTake him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.\u201d",
    "19.7": "The Jews answered him, \u201cWe have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.\u201d",
    "19.8": "When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.",
    "19.9": "He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d But Jesus gave him no answer.",
    "19.10": "Pilate therefore said to him, \u201cAren\u2019t you speaking to me? Don\u2019t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?\u201d",
    "19.11": "Jesus answered,\u201cYou would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.\u201d",
    "19.12": "At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, \u201cIf you release this man, you aren\u2019t Caesar\u2019s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!\u201d",
    "19.13": "When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called \u201cThe Pavement\u201d, but in Hebrew, \u201cGabbatha.\u201d",
    "19.14": "Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, \u201cBehold, your King!\u201d",
    "19.15": "They cried out, \u201cAway with him! Away with him! Crucify him!\u201dPilate said to them, \u201cShall I crucify your King?\u201dThe chief priests answered, \u201cWe have no king but Caesar!\u201d",
    "19.16": "So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.",
    "19.17": "He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called \u201cThe Place of a Skull\u201d, which is called in Hebrew, \u201cGolgotha\u201d,",
    "19.18": "where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.",
    "19.19": "Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, \u201cJESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.\u201d",
    "19.20": "Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.",
    "19.21": "The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, \u201cDon\u2019t write, \u2018The King of the Jews,\u2019 but, \u2018he said, \u201cI am King of the Jews.\u201d\u2019\u201d",
    "19.22": "Pilate answered, \u201cWhat I have written, I have written.\u201d",
    "19.23": "Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.",
    "19.24": "Then they said to one another, \u201cLet\u2019s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be,\u201d that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,\u201cThey parted my garments among them.For my cloak they cast lots.\u201dTherefore the soldiers did these things.",
    "19.25": "But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother\u2019s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.",
    "19.26": "Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother,\u201cWoman, behold, your son!\u201d",
    "19.27": "Then he said to the disciple,\u201cBehold, your mother!\u201d From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.",
    "19.28": "After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said,\u201cI am thirsty.\u201d",
    "19.29": "Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.",
    "19.30": "When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said,\u201cIt is finished.\u201d He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.",
    "19.31": "Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn\u2019t remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.",
    "19.32": "Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;",
    "19.33": "but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn\u2019t break his legs.",
    "19.34": "However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.",
    "19.35": "He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.",
    "19.36": "For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, \u201cA bone of him will not be broken.\u201d",
    "19.37": "Again another Scripture says, \u201cThey will look on him whom they pierced.\u201d",
    "19.38": "After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus\u2019 body. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.",
    "19.39": "Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.",
    "19.40": "So they took Jesus\u2019 body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.",
    "19.41": "Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.",
    "19.42": "Then because of the Jews\u2019 Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.",
    "20.1": "Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.",
    "20.2": "Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, \u201cThey have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don\u2019t know where they have laid him!\u201d",
    "20.3": "Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.",
    "20.4": "They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.",
    "20.5": "Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn\u2019t enter in.",
    "20.6": "Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,",
    "20.7": "and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.",
    "20.8": "So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.",
    "20.9": "For as yet they didn\u2019t know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.",
    "20.10": "So the disciples went away again to their own homes.",
    "20.11": "But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,",
    "20.12": "and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.",
    "20.13": "They told her, \u201cWoman, why are you weeping?\u201dShe said to them, \u201cBecause they have taken away my Lord, and I don\u2019t know where they have laid him.\u201d",
    "20.14": "When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn\u2019t know that it was Jesus.",
    "20.15": "Jesus said to her,\u201cWoman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?\u201dShe, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, \u201cSir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.\u201d",
    "20.16": "Jesus said to her,\u201cMary.\u201dShe turned and said to him, \u201cRabboni!\u201d which is to say, \u201cTeacher!\u201d",
    "20.17": "Jesus said to her,\u201cDon\u2019t hold me, for I haven\u2019t yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, \u2018I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.\u2019\u201d",
    "20.18": "Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.",
    "20.19": "When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the middle, and said to them,\u201cPeace be to you.\u201d",
    "20.20": "When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.",
    "20.21": "Jesus therefore said to them again,\u201cPeace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.\u201d",
    "20.22": "When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them,\u201cReceive the Holy Spirit!",
    "20.23": "If you forgive anyone\u2019s sins, they have been forgiven them. If you retain anyone\u2019s sins, they have been retained.\u201d",
    "20.24": "But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn\u2019t with them when Jesus came.",
    "20.25": "The other disciples therefore said to him, \u201cWe have seen the Lord!\u201dBut he said to them, \u201cUnless I see in his hands the print of the nails, put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.\u201d",
    "20.26": "After eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the middle, and said,\u201cPeace be to you.\u201d",
    "20.27": "Then he said to Thomas,\u201cReach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into my side. Don\u2019t be unbelieving, but believing.\u201d",
    "20.28": "Thomas answered him, \u201cMy Lord and my God!\u201d",
    "20.29": "Jesus said to him,\u201cBecause you have seen me,you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed.\u201d",
    "20.30": "Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;",
    "20.31": "but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.",

    "21.6": "He said to them,\u201cCast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.\u201dThey cast it therefore, and now they weren\u2019t able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.",
    "21.7": "That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \u201cIt\u2019s the Lord!\u201dSo when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea.",
    "21.8": "But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net full of fish.",
    "21.9": "So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.",

    "21.21": "Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, \u201cLord, what about this man?\u201d",
    "21.22": "Jesus said to him,\u201cIf I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.\u201d",
    "21.23": "This saying therefore went out among the brothers, that this disciple wouldn\u2019t die. Yet Jesus didn\u2019t say to him that he wouldn\u2019t die, but,\u201cIf I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?\u201d",
    "21.24": "This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true.",
